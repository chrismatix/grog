# Grog

The build tool for the grug-brained developer.

Grog **is** a mono-repo build tool that is agnostic on how you run your build commands, but instead focuses on caching and parallel execution.

Grog **is not** a complete replacement for Bazel or Pants. Instead, think of it as the intermediary step that will allow your team to keep using existing build tools while benefitting from cached parallel runs.
