# Dev Log

Observations, ramblings, and learnings along the way.

Setup, the git workflow, and started working on the cli integration testing. Integration testing will be super helpful here since we can also use the test repos as a sandbox for testing out designs. -C

Set up the grog `DESIGN.md` to organize my thoughts a bit. 
Most notable success is infecting/radicalizing Luca with this idea which brings a flood of good ideas and the promise of a very strong contributor. -C

Last night, I finally had the idea to make the idea for all of this work which is to have the BUILD files be user executables (or plain data files).
I could not sleep, because I was so excited at the idea and because I could picture every aspect of how this would work.
Today I scoped out a simple program structure based on the loading, analysis, and execution phase in bazel. -C
