## What is Grog?

Grog coordinates the commands you already use and runs only what changed in parallel. It tracks inputs, caches outputs, and keeps the rest of your repo idle.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Describe targets.</strong> Declare commands, inputs, outputs, and dependencies in BUILD files.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Run a build.</strong> Grog schedules the graph, runs tasks in parallel, and caches results.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rerun faster.</strong> Only targets affected by a change execute again.
    </li>
  </ol>
</Steps>
