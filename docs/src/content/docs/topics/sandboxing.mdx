Grog plans to support running build commands in isolated Docker environments.
This will allow you

<Aside type="caution">
  This feature is not ready yet. The docs instead reflect the planned
  implementation in the spirit of Documentation-driven Development. So let us
  know what you think!

## Environment Config

An environment configuration exists on the build graph, but is distinct from targets.
You can define a docker environment like so:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="YAML">
    ```yaml
    targets:
      - name: foo
        # ...

    environments:
      - name: arm64
        type: docker
        dependencies:
          - arm64-image
        docker_image: arm64-builder
        defaults:
          mount_dependencies: transitive # or: none, direct
          mount_dependency_inputs: true # whether to also mount the input files of dependencies
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's go over the fields of an environment configuration:

- `name`: This defines the environments label which works the same way as for [targets](/reference/labels).
- `dependencies`: Environments do not define any build steps. Instead, you can use `dependencies` to define which targets need to build for this environment to function.
- `docker_image`: This is the tag of the image that will be used in docker environments. Typically one of the environments dependencies would build this image tag, but you can provide any image you want here.
- `defaults`: Defines execution defaults for an environment. Details tbd.
