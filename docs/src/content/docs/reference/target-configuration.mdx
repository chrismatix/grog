description: Targets define what builds to run and how. This reference covers all the configuration options for a target.

## Overview

A **target** is the fundamental unit of work in Grog. It defines:

- What command to run (`command`)
- Which files to track for changes (`inputs`)
- What artifacts it produces (`outputs`)
- Which other targets it depends on (`dependencies`)
- Optional metadata like platform constraints and tags

Grog uses this information to ensure incremental, cached, and parallel builds.

| `environment_variables` | `Record<string, string>` | Additional environment variables set when running the target           |

<Aside type="note">
  Targets with names ending in `test` are automatically treated as test targets.
  They will be executed with `grog test` but not with `grog build` unless
  explicitly requested.

## Field Details

### name

A unique identifier for the target within its package. This forms part of the target's label.

### command

The shell command or script to execute. This can be a single line or a multi-line script using YAML's `|` syntax or equivalent in other formats.
The command is optional which can be useful, for instance, when defining executable scripts ([read more](/guides/binary-outputs)).

Grog also injects the following environment variables into the target's environment:

| Variable Name   | Description                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GROG_TARGET`   | The full label of the target. E.g. `//path/to/package:target_name`) |
| `GROG_OS`       | The grog binary's target operating system. E.g. `linux`.            |
| `GROG_ARCH`     | The grog binary's target architecture. E.g. `amd64`.                |
| `GROG_PLATFORM` | The grog binary's target platform. E.g. `linux/amd64`.              |
| `GROG_PACKAGE`  | The path to the package directory. E.g. `path/to/package`.          |
| `GROG_GIT_HASH` | The output of `git rev-parse HEAD`. Useful for tagging artifacts.   |

### inputs

A list of files or glob patterns that Grog monitors for changes.
When any input file changes, the target will be rebuilt.

Common glob patterns:

- `src/**/*.js` - All JavaScript files in the src directory and its subdirectories
- `*.{png,jpg}` - All PNG and JPG files in the current directory
- `go.mod` - A specific file

<Aside type="caution">
  If your input glob matches some of your output files, Grog will always
  re-build the target. Therefore, it is important to declare all outputs (Grog
  will warn if there is an overlap) and to avoid using globs that match your
  output files.
</Aside>

### exclude_inputs

A list of files or glob patterns to exclude from the resolved `inputs`. This is useful when you want to include a broad pattern in `inputs` but exclude specific files or subdirectories.

Examples:

- If `inputs` includes `src/**/*.js` but you want to exclude test files, you can add `src/**/*.test.js` to `exclude_inputs`
- If `inputs` includes all files in a directory but you want to exclude specific files, you can list them in `exclude_inputs`

<Aside type="note">
  The exclusion happens after all input patterns are resolved, so you can
  exclude specific files that were matched by glob patterns.
</Aside>

### outputs

Files or directories produced by the target. For directories, use the `dir::` prefix. For Docker images, use the `docker::` prefix.

Examples:

- `dist/bundle.js` - A file output
- `dir::dist/assets/` - A directory output
- `docker::myregistry.com/myimage:tag` - A Docker image

### dependencies

Other targets that must be built before this one, specified as labels. Labels can reference:

- Targets in the same package: `:target_name`
- Targets in other packages: `//path/to/package:target_name`

### platform

A platform configuration that restricts where this target can be executed.
This is particularly useful for multi-platform builds (see [docs](/guides/multi-platform-builds)).

The `platform` field has two sub-fields:

- `os`: List of operating systems where this target can run (e.g., "linux", "darwin")
- `arch`: List of CPU architectures where this target can run (e.g., "amd64", "arm64")

When a target has platform constraints defined:

1. Grog checks the current host's OS and architecture
2. Targets that don't match the current platform are skipped

### tags

Tags is a list of unique strings that can be used to group and query targets.
There are a few reserved tags that alter the way grog treats a target:

| Tag Name            | Effect                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| no-cache            | Outputs will neither be stored in nor loaded from the cache backend.                                                                                  |
| multiplatform-cache | By default grog separates target caches by the host platform. Adding this tag causes grog to store the outputs at the same cache key across platforms |

### environment_variables

Key-value pairs of environment variables that will be set for this target during execution.

### timeout

The maximum time the target's command is allowed to run. If the command exceeds this duration, the build or test fails with a timeout error.

Durations are expressed using Go's duration syntax, e.g. `30s`, `5m`.
