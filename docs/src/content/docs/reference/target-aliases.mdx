title: Target Aliases
description: Use aliases to create alternative labels pointing to existing targets.
---

A **target alias** is a lightweight entry in a `BUILD` file that simply points to another target.
It has its own label but no command or outputs. When you build an alias, Grog will
transparently build the aliased target.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Unique identifier for the alias within its package |
| `actual` | `label` | Label of the target that this alias points to |

## Example

```yaml
aliases:
  - name: default
    actual: :build_app
```

Running `grog build :default` would build the `:build_app` target.
