### Target depends on another target that does not match the host platform

```
FATAL: target selection failed: could not select target //:bar because it depends on //:foo, which does not match the platform darwin/arm64
```

This error occurs when try to build `foo`, but somewhere in foo's dependency chain there is a target that is not compatible with the host platform. (See docs).

To resolve this, you can either ensure that `foo` shares the same `platform` selector as `bar` or modify the `bar` build so that it can run on your host platform.
