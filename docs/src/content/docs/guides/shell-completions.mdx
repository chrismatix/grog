title: Shell Completions
description: Enable bash or zsh completions for the grog CLI.
---

Grog ships with a built in `completion` command that can generate shell completion scripts for
`bash` and `zsh`. Installing these scripts enables auto completion of target labels and patterns
for the most common commands.

```bash
# Bash
source <(grog completion bash)

# Zsh
compdef _grog grog
source <(grog completion zsh)
```

Add the lines above to your shell startup files (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to load the completions automatically.
