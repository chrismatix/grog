Common use cases for querying your grog build graph might be:

- Only re-run targets that changed between two commits in CI.
- Understanding the interdependencies of your target.

Grog provides a number of commands that can be chained or combined with tools like `jq` so that you can extract the information that you need:

- [`grog list`](#grog-list): List all targets matching a pattern.
- [`grog deps`](#grog-deps): Get a target's (transitive) dependencies.
- [`grog rdeps`](#grog-rdeps): Get a target's transitive dependants ("reverse dependencies").
- [`grog owners`](#grog-owners): Get all targets that own a set of files as an input.
- [`grog changes`](#grog-changes): Get all targets changed since a given commit.

But before we go into each command individually, we need to cover the basics of how targets can be selected in grog commands.

## Target Selection Basics

Grog commands that accept multiple targets (such as `build`, `test`, and most of the query commands on this page) accept them in the form of a target pattern.
You can read the full specification of target patterns [here](/references/), but here are some common uses:

```shell
# Reference a single target
grog build //package:target_name

# Reference all targets in package and its sub-packages:
grog build //package/...
```

Additionally, you can add tags to your targets that you can then query like so:

```shell
# Build all targets in the `model_training` package
# that have at least one of the tags
grog build --tag=ci-only --tag=python //model_training/...
```

## grog list

`grog list <target-pattern>`

Lists all the targets that are matched by a given target pattern (or all by default).

```shell
grog list //package/...
# Will return
# //package:foo
# //package:bar
# //package/sub-package:baz
# ...

grog list //package:...
# Will return
# //package:foo
# //package:bar
```

## grog deps

`grog deps <target-label> [--transitive]`

Lists all the dependencies listed by a single target.
When specifying `--transitive` it will return the full list of transitive dependencies.

```shell
grog deps //package:server
# Returns the contents of the `deps` field in your BUILD file

grog deps --transitive //package:server
# Recursively gets the `deps` of server's `deps`
```

## grog rdeps

`grog rdeps <target-pattern> [--transitive]`

Lists all the targets that depend on the selected target patterns (basically the reverse direction of `deps`).
Likewise `--transitive` will return the full list of transitive dependants.

```shell
grog rdeps //package:server
# Returns all targets that have server in their `deps` field

grog rdeps --transitive //package:server
# Recursively gets the dependants of server's dependants
```

## grog owners

`grog owners <file-list/glob>`

Find the build targets that "own" the provided file in the sense that they are part of their `inputs`.

```shell
grog owners src/app/**/*.go
# Returns all build targets that have
# any of the go files as their input
```

## grog changes

`grog changes <target-pattern> [--since=<commit>] [--dependents=none|transitive]`

Returns all targets whose inputs have been modified since a given commit.
By setting the `dependents` argument you can control if you also want to get the dependent targets that are affected by a change.
The default is `none` which will only return the changed targets while `transitive will return all affected dependants.

```shell
grog changes //server/... --since=origin/main --dependents=transitive
# Returns all targets (and their dependants) in the server target that
# changed compared to your local state of origin/main
```
