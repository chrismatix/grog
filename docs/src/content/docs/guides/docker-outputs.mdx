Many real-world CI/CDs don't just produce files or directories, but package the entire app into a docker image that lives on your local docker engine.
Grog can also cache these, but it is not as straight-forward as caching a file.
This guide will cover

## 1. Setup

The first step is to add the following lines to your `grog.toml`:

```toml
[docker]
enabled = true
```

Next, you need to choose a storage backend for your docker images:

### Filesystem

grog will store your images as a tarball using the (remote) filesystem cache that you configured.
While this is fast to set up it can be quite storage intensive as layers are not deduplicated between caches.

Here is how to enable this option:

```toml
[docker]
enabled = true
backend = "filesystem"
```

### Registry

Using a registry as your backend allows you to store your images in a remote or local Docker registry.
This is more efficient as layers are deduplicated, reducing storage costs.
However, it requires you to have a registry running and accessible.

Hereâ€™s how to enable this option:

```toml
[docker]
enabled = true
backend = "registry"
registry_url = "https://your-registry-url"
```

Replace `https://your-registry-url` with the URL of your Docker registry and the appropriate credentials if authentication is required.
For example, if you're using Docker Hub, your `registry_url` would be `https://index.docker.io/v1/`.
If you're running a private registry locally, you may use something like `http://localhost:5000` as the URL.

**Authentication:** Grog expects your current session to be authenticated. Here is how to do that:

- Docker registry via [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/)
- GCP Artifact Registry [docs](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication)
- AWS ECR [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html)

## 2. Defining docker outputs

<Aside type="caution">
  This feature is not ready yet. The docs instead reflect the planned
  implementation in the spirit of Documentation-driven Development. So let us
  know what you think!
</Aside>

Once your docker storage is set up you can define a docker image output for your target:

```yaml
targets:
  build_img:
    inputs:
      - Dockerfile
      - src/**/*.py
    cmd: docker build -t some-python-image .
    outputs:
      - docker://some-python-image
```

Grog will look for outputs beginning with `docker://` and apply the specified caching strategy to them.
If the resulting image is not found locally, grog will error out.
