## Introduction to Docker Caching

Many real-world CI/CD pipelines don't just produce files or directories but package entire applications into Docker images. Building Docker images can be time-consuming, especially for large applications, making them perfect candidates for caching.

Grog can cache Docker images, allowing you to:

- Skip building images when their inputs haven't changed
- Share images between team members using a remote cache
- Integrate Docker builds into your dependency graph
- Push images to registries only when needed

This guide covers how to set up Docker caching, configure storage backends, and define Docker outputs in your build targets.

## Setting Up Docker Caching

### Choose a Storage Backend

Grog supports two storage backends for Docker images:

#### Filesystem Backend (Default)

The filesystem backend stores Docker images as tarballs using your configured (remote) filesystem cache:

```toml
[docker]
backend = "tarball"  # This is the default, so it's optional
```

**Advantages:**

- Simple to set up
- Works with any filesystem cache
- No additional infrastructure required

**Disadvantages:**

- More storage-intensive as layers aren't deduplicated between images
- Slower for large images

#### Registry Backend

<Aside>
  To use the registry backend you need to have docker installed on your machine.

The registry backend stores Docker images in a Docker registry:

```toml
[docker]
backend = "registry"
registry_url = "https://your-registry-url"
```

**Advantages:**

- More efficient storage through layer deduplication
- Better performance for large images
- Familiar workflow for Docker users

**Disadvantages:**

- Requires a registry to be running and accessible
- Requires docker to be installed on your machine
- Needs authentication setup

### 3. Registry Authentication

When using the registry backend, Grog expects your current session to be authenticated with the registry. Here's how to authenticate with common registries:

- **Docker Hub**: Use `docker login`
- **Google Artifact Registry**: Follow the [GCP authentication docs](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication)
- **AWS ECR**: Follow the [AWS ECR authentication docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html)
- **GitHub Container Registry**: Use `docker login ghcr.io`

<Aside>
  For CI environments, you'll need to ensure authentication happens as part of
  your CI pipeline before Grog runs.

## Defining Docker Outputs

Once your Docker storage is set up, you can define Docker image outputs for your targets:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_api_image
    inputs:
      - Dockerfile
      - src/**/*.go
      - go.mod
      - go.sum
    command: |
      # Build the Docker image
      docker build -t api-service:latest .
    outputs:
      # Cache the local image
      - docker::api-service:latest
```

## Using Docker Images in Dependent Targets

You can use Docker images built by one target in dependent targets:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_api_image
    inputs:
      - Dockerfile
      - src/**/*.go
    command: docker build -t api-service:latest .
    outputs:
      - docker::api-service:latest

  - name: integration_test
    dependencies:
      - :build_api_image
    command: |
      # The api-service image is now available locally
      docker run --rm api-service:latest --version
      # Run tests against the image
      go test -tags=integration ./tests/...
```

## Multi-platform Docker Images
