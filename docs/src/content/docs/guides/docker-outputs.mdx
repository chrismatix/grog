Many real-world CI/CDs don't just produce files or directories, but package the entire app into a docker image that lives on your local docker engine.
Grog can also cache these, but it is not as straight-forward as caching a file.
This guide will cover

## 1. Setup

The first step is to add the following lines to your `grog.toml`:

```toml
[docker]
enabled = true
```

Next, you need to choose a storage backend for your docker images:

### Filesystem

Grog will store your images as a tarball using the (remote) filesystem cache that you configured.
While this is fast to set up it can be quite storage intensive as layers are not deduplicated between caches.

Here is how to enable this option:

```toml
[docker]
enabled = true
backend = "tarball" # Optional as this is the default
```

### Registry

Using a registry as your backend allows you to store your images in a remote or local Docker registry.
This is more efficient as layers are deduplicated, reducing storage costs.
However, it requires you to have a registry running and accessible.

Hereâ€™s how to enable this option:

```toml
[docker]
backend = "registry"
registry_url = "https://your-registry-url"
```

Replace `https://your-registry-url` with the URL of your Docker registry and the appropriate credentials if authentication is required.
For example, if you're using Docker Hub, your `registry_url` would be `https://index.docker.io/v1/`.
If you're running a private registry locally, you may use something like `http://localhost:5000` as the URL.

**Authentication:** Grog expects your current session to be authenticated. Here is how to do that:

- Docker registry via [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/)
- GCP Artifact Registry [docs](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication)
- AWS ECR [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/registry_auth.html)

## 2. Defining docker outputs

Once your docker storage is set up you can define a docker image output for your target:

```yaml
targets:
  build_img:
    inputs:
      - Dockerfile
      - src/**/*.py
    cmd: docker build -t some-python-image .
    outputs:
      - docker::some-local-python-image
      - docker::registry.io/repository/some-python-image
```

Grog will treat docker outputs differently if you explicitly specify a registry URL:

- **Without** registry URL:

  - On completion of the build Grog will push the local image to the registry cache.
  - On subsequent builds, Grog will only load the image from the registry cache if it does not exist locally.
  - Use this for local images that you may want to use in tests or builds.

- **With** registry URL:
  - On completion of the build Grog will push the image tag to the registry.
  - On subsequent builds, Grog will push the cached image to the registry tag if it does not exist yet.
  - Use this when deploying to a remote registry.
