## Why Build for Multiple Platforms?

There are a number of use cases for building code for different platforms. Common examples include:

- Building Docker images for both ARM64 (Apple Silicon, AWS Graviton) and AMD64 architectures
- Creating binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Supporting different CPU architectures for embedded systems
- Ensuring your application works across cloud providers with different infrastructure

Grog provides several approaches to for handling multi-platform builds.

## Approaches to Multi-platform Building

There are two primary strategies for building for multiple platforms:

1. **Cross-compilation**: Create a single build target that outputs artifacts for multiple platforms
2. **Platform-specific targets**: Create separate build targets for each platform and run them on appropriate hosts

Grog supports both approaches, with platform selectors providing special support for the second strategy.

## Cross-compilation Approach

Cross-compilation involves building for a different platform than the one you're running on.
Many languages and build tools support this out-of-the-box.

### Example: Go Cross-compilation

Go has excellent built-in cross-compilation support:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_multi_platform
    command: |
      # Build for Linux AMD64
      GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/myapp-linux-amd64 ./cmd/myapp

      # Build for macOS ARM64
      GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 go build -o dist/myapp-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/myapp

      # Build for Windows AMD64
      GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/myapp-windows-amd64.exe ./cmd/myapp
    inputs:
      - cmd/**/*.go
      - internal/**/*.go
      - go.mod
      - go.sum
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux-amd64
      - dist/myapp-darwin-arm64
      - dist/myapp-windows-amd64.exe
```

### Example: Multi-platform Docker Images

For Docker images, you can use Docker's BuildX feature:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_multi_arch_image
    command: |
      # Set up Docker BuildX builder with multi-platform support
      docker buildx create --name multiplatform-builder --use

      # Build and push multi-platform image
      docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
        -t registry.example.com/myapp:latest \
        --push .
    inputs:
      - Dockerfile
      - src/**/*
    outputs:
      - docker::registry.example.com/myapp:latest
```

<Aside type="note">
  Cross-compilation works well for many languages but may have limitations for
  certain types of applications, especially those with native dependencies. In
  those cases, platform-specific targets might be necessary.

## Platform-specific Targets with Platform Selectors

Grog's platform selectors allow you to define targets that only run on specific platforms.
When a target doesn't match the current host's platform, Grog will skip it automatically.

### Defining Platform Selectors

You can specify platform requirements using the `platform` field:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_linux_amd64
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-linux-amd64 ./cmd/myapp
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
      arch:
        - amd64
    inputs:
      - cmd/**/*.go
      - go.mod
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux-amd64

  - name: build_darwin_arm64
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/myapp
    platform:
      os:
        - darwin
      arch:
        - arm64
    inputs:
      - cmd/**/*.go
      - go.mod
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-darwin-arm64
```

In this example:

- `build_linux_amd64` will only run on Linux AMD64 hosts
- `build_darwin_arm64` will only run on macOS ARM64 hosts (like Apple Silicon Macs)

### Platform Selector Behavior

When you run `grog build`, Grog will:

1. Check each target's platform selector against the current host
2. Skip targets that don't match the current platform
3. Build targets that do match the platform

This allows you to define all platform variants in a single build file, but only build the ones appropriate for the current environment.

### Handling Dependencies with Platform Selectors

When a target depends on a platform-specific target, Grog enforces platform compatibility:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: linux_binary
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-linux ./cmd/myapp
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux

  - name: package_linux
    dependencies:
      - :linux_binary
    command: tar -czf dist/myapp-linux.tar.gz dist/myapp-linux
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux.tar.gz
```

If you try to build `package_linux` on a non-Linux platform, Grog will fail with an error because the dependency `linux_binary` cannot be built on the current platform.

<Aside type="caution">
  When using platform selectors with dependencies, ensure that dependent targets
  have compatible platform selectors. Otherwise, Grog will fail when it can't
  build a required dependency.
</Aside>

## Platform-agnostic Dependencies

Sometimes you need to create platform-agnostic targets that depend on platform-specific ones.
For these cases, you can use conditional logic in your build commands:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: test_all_platforms
    dependencies:
      - :build_linux_amd64 # Will be skipped on non-Linux/AMD64 platforms
      - :build_darwin_arm64 # Will be skipped on non-macOS/ARM64 platforms
    command: |
      # Run tests for whatever platform we're on
      if [ "$(uname)" == "Darwin" ]; then
        ./test_darwin.sh
      elif [ "$(uname)" == "Linux" ]; then
        ./test_linux.sh
      else
        echo "Unsupported platform for testing"
        exit 1
      fi
```
