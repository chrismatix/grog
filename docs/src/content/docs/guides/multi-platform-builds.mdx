## Building for Multiple Platforms

Often you will want your code to run on multiple operating systems and architectures.
For example, you might want to build binaries or docker images that run both on Linux amd64 and MacOS arm64.
Grog has one built-in solution for this: platform selectors.

<Aside>
  We are also actively working on build virtualization via docker which will allow you to build for multiple platforms. Stay tuned!

## Platform Selectors

Grog's platform selectors allow you to define targets that only run on specific platforms.
When a target doesn't match the current host's platform, Grog will **skip** it automatically.

### Defining Platform Selectors

You can specify platform requirements using the `platform` field:

```yaml
default_platform:
  os:
    - linux
  arch:
    - amd64

targets:
  # default_platform is applied here
  - name: build_linux_amd64
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-linux-amd64 ./cmd/myapp
    inputs:
      - cmd/**/*.go
      - go.mod
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux-amd64

  - name: build_darwin_arm64
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-darwin-arm64 ./cmd/myapp
    # This overrides default_platform
    platform:
      os:
        - darwin
      arch:
        - arm64
    inputs:
      - cmd/**/*.go
      - go.mod
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-darwin-arm64
```

In this example:

- `build_linux_amd64` will only run on Linux AMD64 hosts
- `build_darwin_arm64` will only run on macOS ARM64 hosts (like Apple Silicon Macs)

### Platform Selector Behavior

When you run `grog build`, Grog will:

1. Check each target's platform selector against the os and arch the grog binary was built for
2. Skip targets that don't match the current platform
3. Build targets that do match the platform

This allows you to define all platform variants in a single build file, but only build the ones appropriate for the current environment.

### Skipping platform selectors

There may be scenarios where you want to skip platform selectors.
To do so, pass the `--all-platforms`, (shorthand: `-a`) flag to build and querying commands.

### Handling Dependencies with Platform Selectors

When a target depends on a platform-specific target, Grog enforces platform compatibility:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: linux_binary
    command: go build -o dist/myapp-linux ./cmd/myapp
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux

  - name: package_linux
    dependencies:
      - :linux_binary
    command: tar -czf dist/myapp-linux.tar.gz dist/myapp-linux
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
    outputs:
      - dist/myapp-linux.tar.gz
```

If you try to build `package_linux` on a non-Linux platform, Grog will fail with an error because the dependency `linux_binary` cannot be built on the current platform.

<Aside type="caution">
  When using platform selectors with dependencies, ensure that dependent targets
  have compatible platform selectors. Otherwise, Grog will fail when it can't
  build a required dependency.
