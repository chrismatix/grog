description: Learn how to build for multiple platforms using Grog's platform selectors.
---

There may be scenarios where you want to build outputs for different platforms or operating systems.
Say, for instance, that you want create to create an arm64 and an amd64 docker image as part of your build CI.
There are two ways of tackling this problem:

1. Create a multi-platform build target: Make your `cmd` script output two different build targets.
2. Create one build target for each platform and run them on separate hosts.

We are actively working on supporting `1.` via automatic build virtualization, but for now this is a manual process.
For the second option, however, there is a tailored feature that is presented in the next section.

## Platform Selectors

For each build target Grog allows you to specify a platform selector using the `platform` field.
Specifying a platform selector will change Grog's target selection such that if a target does not match your hosts platform it will be effectively invisible.

Take, for instance, the following build target:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: target_a
    cmd: ...
    platform:
      os:
        - linux
        - darwin
      arch:
        - amd64
```

If you run all build targets, Grog will automatically skip `target_a` if your host is not either `linux` or `darwin` while also having the `amd64` architecture.
But what happens if we add a `target_b` that depends on `target_a`?
In this case grog will fail if you try to build `target_b` when you cannot build `target_a`.
