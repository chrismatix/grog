An important aspect of building a reproducible build process is installing the necessary tool chain of compilers, linters etc.
Grog provides two simple mechanisms to facilitate that process that we will discuss below:

- `Binary Outputs`: Targets that output an executable file can be used as a tool to build other targets.

  - **Advantage:** Allows caching and better reproducibility between hosts.
  - **Disadvantage:** Many tools do not come as single portable binaries.

- `Bin-path Outputs`: An output type that only checks if a tool is already installed on the host platform.
  - **Advantage:** Easy to set up as you can just use the installation scripts as specified by the tool.
  - **Disadvantage:** Worse in terms of reproducibility as we cannot verify the version or build of the tool.

## Binary Outputs

Each target can register a single `bin_output` field that has to be of type file.
When the build completes grog will mark this file as executable and expose it dependant targets using a shell command.
The following package illustrates how this works:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: some_build_target
    inputs:
      - requirements.txt
    deps:
      - :a_bin_tool
    cmd: |
      # Using the bin tool
      $(bin :a_bin_tool) inputs

  # You can alos run that binary directly by running:
  # grog run //package:a_bin_tool -- arg1 arg2
  - name: a_bin_tool
    cmd: |
      echo "I am a binary" >> dist/bin
    bin_output: dist/bin
```
