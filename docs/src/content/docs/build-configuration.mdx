## Configuration Approaches

Grog takes a flexible approach to configuration that emphasizes **simplicity** and **extensibility**. It has minimal opinions about how you define builds, as long as each package can output a structured definition of its build targets.

You can configure Grog builds in four different ways:

- **Static configuration:** Simple `BUILD.{json,yaml}` files that define build targets for each package. Great for getting started.
- **Makefiles:** Add special comments to your existing `Makefile`s to run make goals while benefiting from Grog's execution model.
  Perfect for gradually adopting Grog when you already use Makefiles.
- **Starlark:** Use the [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) language (similar to Python) to define builds with functions and macros. Familiar to Bazel users.
- **Pkl:** Use the [Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/) configuration language to create reusable configuration elements.
  Ideal for scaling your build configuration with strong typing.

## Static Configuration

The simplest way to define your build targets is to create a `BUILD.json` or `BUILD.yaml` file in your package directory. This file defines all build targets for that package in your monorepo.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="YAML">
```yaml
targets:
  - name: build_app
    command: npm run build
    dependencies:
      - :generate_proto
      - //path/to/other/package:target_name
    inputs:
      - src/**/*.js
      - package.json
    outputs:
      - dist/bundle.js

- name: generate_proto
  command: "protoc --js_out=src/generated proto/\*.proto"
  inputs:
  - proto/\*.proto
    outputs:
  - dir::src/generated

````
Save this as `BUILD.yaml` in your project directory.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JSON">
```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "name": "build_app",
      "command": "npm run build",
      "dependencies": [
        ":generate_proto",
        "//path/to/other/package:target_name"
      ],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.js", "package.json"],
      "outputs": ["dist/bundle.js"]
    },
    {
      "name": "generate_proto",
      "command": "protoc --js_out=src/generated proto/*.proto",
      "inputs": ["proto/*.proto"],
      "outputs": ["dir::src/generated"]
    }
  ]
}
````

Save this as `BUILD.json` in your project directory.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also define simple **aliases** that point to other targets:

```yaml
aliases:
  - name: default
    actual: :build_app
```

Running `grog build :default` would build `:build_app`.

For a complete list of available options, see the [target configuration reference](/reference/target-configuration).

## Makefile Integration

If you already use Makefiles extensively and want to continue using them while benefiting from Grog's execution model, you can add special comments to your existing Makefiles.

The schema is straightforward:

- Grog looks for a line that starts with `# @grog`
- Everything between that line and the next make goal is parsed as YAML configuration
- The command will be `make <goal>`
- If the name is left empty, the goal name becomes the target name

Here's an example:

```Makefile
# @grog
# inputs:
#   - src/**/*.js
#   - package.json
# outputs:
#   - dist/bundle.js
# dependencies:
#   - :generate_proto
#   - //path/to/other/package:target_name
build_app:
	npm run build

# @grog
# inputs:
#   - proto/*.proto
# outputs:
#   - dir::src/generated
generate_proto:
	protoc --js_out=src/generated proto/*.proto
```

This Makefile exposes the targets `build_app` and `generate_proto` to Grog, allowing you to run them with `grog build :build_app` or `grog build :generate_proto`.

## Starlark Configuration

[Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) is a Python-like configuration language originally created for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). If you're familiar with Bazel or prefer a Python-like syntax, Starlark provides a powerful way to define your build targets using functions and macros.

Here's the same build configuration as above, but using Starlark:

```python
# BUILD.star
target(
    name = "build_app",
    command = "npm run build",
    dependencies = [
        ":generate_proto",
        "//path/to/other/package:target_name",
    ],
    inputs = [
        "src/**/*.js",
        "package.json",
    ],
    outputs = ["dist/bundle.js"],
)

target(
    name = "generate_proto",
    command = "protoc --js_out=src/generated proto/*.proto",
    inputs = ["proto/*.proto"],
    outputs = ["dir::src/generated"],
)
```

Save this as `BUILD.star` or `BUILD.bzl` in your project directory.

### Creating Reusable Macros with Starlark

One of Starlark's key features is the ability to create reusable macros using functions. For example, if you want a standard setup for TypeScript projects that includes build, test, and format targets:

```python
# rules.star
def ts_package(name, srcs = [], deps = []):
    """Creates a TypeScript package with build, test, and format targets."""

    srcs = ["./src/**"] + srcs

    target(
        name = name,
        command = "tsc",
        inputs = srcs,
        outputs = ["./dist/**"],
        dependencies = deps,
    )

    target(
        name = name + "_test",
        command = "node --test ./tests",
        inputs = srcs + ["./tests/**"],
        dependencies = deps,
    )

    target(
        name = name + "_format",
        command = "prettier --write .",
        inputs = srcs + ["./tests/**"],
    )
```

You can then use this macro in your BUILD files:

```python
# packages/example/BUILD.star
load("//rules.star", "ts_package")

ts_package(
    name = "example",
    deps = ["//packages/common"],
)
```

This will create three targets: `example`, `example_test`, and `example_format`.

### Load Statement

The `load()` statement allows you to import macros and functions from other Starlark files:

- Use `//path/to/file.star` for absolute paths from the workspace root
- Use relative paths like `./rules.star` or `../shared/rules.star` for relative imports

## Pkl Configuration

<Aside>
  **Requirement**: You need to install the Pkl CLI first. See the [official
  installation
  guide](https://pkl-lang.org/main/current/pkl-cli/index.html#installation).
</Aside>

As your codebase grows, maintaining consistent build configurations across packages becomes tedious. For example, if you want a generic Java build process that's consistent across your entire monorepo, copying configurations between packages is error-prone and difficult to maintain.

[Pkl](https://pkl-lang.org/) is a configuration language designed specifically for creating reusable configuration macros. With Pkl, you can:

- Define configuration macros that can be shared within your monorepo or even across the internet
- Get semantic highlighting and auto-completion with IDE plugins
- Create modular, reusable build configurations

Here's the same build configuration as above, but using Pkl:

```Pkl
amends "package://grog.build/releases/v0.16.1/grog@0.16.1#/package.pkl"

targets {
  new {
    name = "build_app"
    command = "npm run build"
    dependencies {
      ":generate_proto"
      "//path/to/other/package:target_name"
    }
    inputs {
      "src/**/*.js"
      "package.json"
    }
    outputs {
      "dist/bundle.js"
    }
  }

  new {
    name = "generate_proto"
    command = "protoc --js_out=src/generated proto/*.proto"
    inputs {
      "proto/*.proto"
    }
    outputs {
      "dir::src/generated"
    }
  }
}
```

### Creating Reusable Build Macros

One of Pkl's strengths is the ability to create reusable build macros.
For example, if you want a standard setup for Next.js projects that includes installing dependencies and building the app, you can create a reusable macro:

```Pkl
import "package://grog.build/releases/v0.16.1/grog@0.16.1#/package.pkl"

// Create a function that returns
// a list of targets for a Next.js app
// using pkl's class-as-a-function pattern
class App {
  app_name: String

  fixed targets: Listing<package.Target> = new Listing<package.Target> {
    new {
      name = app_name + "_install"
      command = "npm install"
      inputs {
        "package.json"
        "package-lock.json"
      }
    }

    new {
      name = app_name + "_build"
      command = "npm run build"
      dependencies {
        ":" + app_name + "_install"
      }
      inputs {
        "src/**/*.js"
        "src/**/*.jsx"
        "src/**/*.ts"
        "src/**/*.tsx"
      }
      outputs {
        "dir::.next"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can store this in a file called `nextjs.pkl` somewhere in your repository and import it wherever you need it:

```Pkl
import "nextjs.pkl"

targets {
  // This will add both the install and build targets
  // with the prefix "my-app"
  ...(nextjs.App) {
    app_name = "my-app"
  }.targets

  // You can also add custom targets
  new {
    name = "custom_target"
    command = "echo 'Hello, world!'"
  }
}
```

This approach allows you to standardize build configurations across your monorepo while still allowing for customization where needed.
