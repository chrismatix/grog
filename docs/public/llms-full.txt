# Grog Docs: Expanded LLM Context

## Project
Grog is a language-agnostic build orchestrator for monorepos.
It executes target graphs in parallel, hashes inputs for incremental builds, and reuses cached outputs locally or remotely.

## Typical Workflow
1. Install the `grog` binary.
2. Initialize repository config.
3. Define build targets in BUILD files.
4. Run `grog build` on labels or packages.
5. Re-run to benefit from caching and incremental execution.

## Common Commands
- `grog build //...` - build all targets in the repo.
- `grog build //package:target_name` - build one target.
- `grog test //...` - run targets intended for test workflows.
- `grog check //...` - validate graph and config without executing builds.
- Query workflows: see querying docs for labels, tag filtering, and reverse dependencies.
